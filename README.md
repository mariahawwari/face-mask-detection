# Face Mask Detection 😷

This project uses Deep Learning and OpenCV to detect whether people are wearing face masks or not.  
It can be useful in public places, hospitals, airports, and workplaces where safety and health are a priority.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains two categories of images:
- `with_mask`: people wearing masks
- `without_mask`: people without masks

You can find similar datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

## 🧠 Model

The model was built using:
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Trained for 5 epochs on a balanced dataset
- Achieved very high accuracy

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

---

## 📸 Testing

The trained model (`mask_detector_model.h5`) was tested on new images, and successfully predicted whether a person is wearing a mask.
